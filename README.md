# Fraud Detection Model

This repository contains a fraud detection model implemented in Python. The model is designed to identify fraudulent transactions based on the provided dataset.

## Dataset

The fraud detection model uses the "Fraud.csv" dataset, which contains information about various transactions. The dataset includes features such as transaction type, amount, account balances, and other relevant attributes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>



2. Navigate to the project directory:


cd fraud-detection-model


3. Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt



## Usage

1. Run the "fraud_detection_model.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the fraud detection model.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the model using various machine learning algorithms.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve analysis.
4. Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize its performance.

## Results

The fraud detection model demonstrates promising performance in detecting fraudulent transactions. It identifies key factors such as transaction type, amount, account balances, step, and flagged transactions as predictors of fraudulent activity.
